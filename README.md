# Simplicial

A library for computing homology of simplicial complexes

## Features
- Manipulating chains
- Computing simplicial homology (with coefficients in Z)

## TODO
- Right now, we compute merely the betti numbers. A nice
  extension would be to compute actual generators for the
  homology groups. That would perhaps be useful for doing
  persistent homology.
- We could have support for some non-Z coefficients,
  especially for computing homology over arbitrary fields.
  We just need to code a gaussian elimination.
- Perhaps the library could be re-architected to be nicer to use.
